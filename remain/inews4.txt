This is your chance to shape the nation’s future 

Whatever happens on 23 June, it won’t be the i wot won it. Some media like the sound of their own voice before a big vote, trying to claim afterwards that they swung the result. Here at i we have a rather shocking opinion: the public are capable of making up their own minds. Our job at i is to give you the facts, to try to provide impartial coverage that might help you to make your decision – alongside a mix of thought-provoking voices from across the debate, of course. That’s why today’s edition is wrapped in a You Decide campaign cover – the first in a series. Turned off by the hysteria A significant minority of voters are still undecided. Many people (especially undecideds and the young) are fed up with coverage of the campaign; turned off by the hysteria from politicians and press. When we launched i in 2010, we tried to create a very different sort of newspaper, led by its readers. Your message to us has always been clear: news, not spin. At last year’s general election, every national newspaper endorsed a political party, except i. In Scotland’s independence referendum two years ago, i won plaudits for refusing to push an agenda in its news coverage. Britain’s future won’t be decided by editors, media owners, big business or hysterical politicians – but by you. #idecide Get involved This You Decide campaign cover is the first in a series. Who do you want to feature on the next cover? Have you spotted an outrageous untruth during campaigning? You can get involved in the campaign on social media using the hashtag #idecide
