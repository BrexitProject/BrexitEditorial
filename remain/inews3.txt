New lead for Brexit has turned up the temperature on campaign Oliver Duff3 yearsFriday June 10th 2016 The i newsletter News for free thinkers Today, we run a startling poll that shows Leave opening a sizeable gap over Remain, taking account of respondents’ likelihood to vote. You can read the story here – and it is news that will be read in No 10 and on Boris’s battle bus. Three caveats: There are still 13 days until the referendum. Opinion polling online (such as today’s ORB survey) has been showing stronger results for Leave than via telephone polling. Polling is not prophecy, as we know well. Eleven days before Scotland voted on independence, the rest of the UK – blind to how tight the contest had become – woke up to the idea that their cousins north of the wall might just take a walk on their own. Scotland parallels The reason: a poll in the Sunday Times that showed nationalists had taken the lead and were “poised to triumph”. The survey (since named “The Shipman poll” by wags after the Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman) electrified the contest. Now, momentum in Brexit campaigning has been edging towards Leave for weeks, if the public is to be believed. The survey does fit with what Labour MPs from the Midlands and the North of England are saying privately, from their campaigning this week. Expect the temperature to rocket.
