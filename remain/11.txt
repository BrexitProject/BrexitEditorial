Voice of the Mirror: Britain would be poorer country if we quit Europe

George Osborne’s figures are iffy, as is the norm with this tricky Chancellor, but there is no doubt that Britain would be a poorer country if we left Europe.

Putting an exact figure on quitting the European Union is impossible without a time machine to fly into the future then shift back. And recent forecasts published by the Treasury have been, to put it mildly, way out.

Yet common sense reinforces the economic experts’ warning of a cost, perhaps enormous, in jobs, incomes, prosperity and growth of ripping our nation out of the huge market that is the family of 27 neighbouring states.

The risk of relative isolation will be reinforced this week when US President Barack Obama warns the “special relationship” will not be so special if Britain is not a bridge into Europe.

None of this might matter for some, of course, but we should be clear about the downs, as well as ups, of leaving the EU.
