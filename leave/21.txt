
Nigel Farage's EU diary: We're on a roll to FINALLY quitting Brussels, Ukip leader
WAGONS roll! I have now completely given up on normal life. My suitcase is fully packed and I'm on the double-decker open-top Brexit bus heading north.
We began the week in Barking and Dagenham which is now the fastest-changing borough in the whole of the country.
There are plans to increase the housing stock by 50 per cent in the next 15 years.
Dagenham is the frontline of the immigration debate in this country.
How I would love to see Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne listen to the genuine concerns of people whose children can't get houses and find the schools full.
These are the people whose quality of life has suffered directly due to mass open-door EU immigration.
From Dagenham we went on to Dudley, the heart of the Black Country and the heart of England in many ways.
While the Government seeks to threaten and depress all of us, while some may be worried by project threat, those who have made their minds up to Leave feel more strongly than ever. I detect real anger with the way the establishment is behaving.

We must also remember that many of those making constant threats of the sky falling in if we leave the EU are the very same people and organisations who predicted doom and gloom if we didn't join the euro.
They were wrong then and they are wrong now.
So I'm feeling real energy and passion around this tour already, though I'm not sure that my GP would approve of the diet of pork scratchings and Mars bars but I feel years younger.
The battle bus will continue to go out and meet real people.
I will keep this up until June 23. We will get our country back.
