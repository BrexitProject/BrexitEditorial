
Government has failed to protect its citizens from foreign rapists and murderers
FOR years it has been obvious that the loss of control of our borders has posed a serious threat to the nation’s security and wellbeing. Now yet more proof has emerged of the truth of this.
In news that should be a wake-up call like no other to our so-called political masters, it has emerged that in some parts of the country half of all rape and murder suspects are foreigners and in the country as a whole nearly 20 per cent of crimes are committed by those born outside the UK.
The foremost priority of any government anywhere in the world should be to protect its citizens, be it from external invasion or a threat within. 
Here we have a situation where a series of successive governments have imported this threat, wilfully ignoring the terrible problems caused by mass immigration, problems that have been highlighted over and again by this newspaper.

And still this situation has been allowed to grow out of control. 

We have heard a lot about “Project Fear” from those who would have us remain in the EU. Well, this is the real cause for alarm. 

The Government has allowed great instability to develop within whole swathes of this country while allowing in a criminal element to cause havoc.

There can be no better argument for Brexit and it cannot come too soon.
