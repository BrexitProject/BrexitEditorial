Beefy backs Brexit: Sir Ian Botham says Britain should ‘stand proud’ and leave the EU

One of England’s greatest-ever sportsmen says the UK sends ￡50m a day to fund ‘a racket’ in Brussels

SIR Ian Botham has become the latest big name to back Brexit, saying Britain should “stand proud” outside the EU.

The iconic cricketer is urging the UK to strike out on its own and make trade deals with our “natural friends” in the Commonwealth.

In a piece for the Sunday Times, ‘Beefy’ claims we send ￡50million a day to fund “a racket” in Brussels.

Botham said money which funds the EU “gets swallowed up by waste and corruption”.

In a piece saying he is “going in to bat for my beliefs”, he said: “We have lost the right to govern ourselves, to make our own laws and to choose who comes here.

“The bureaucrats and judges in Brussels have taken on more and more of these powers and if we stay in the EU there is absolutely nothing we can do about it.”
