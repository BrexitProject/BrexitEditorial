
Stop migrants trying to reach Britain by boat or face more chaos, NIGEL FARAGE
I VISITED Dymchurch on Monday to see where the two vessels had been spotted on Saturday night.
I know the area well and have friends on the sea front there who have reported seeing unusual activity for some weeks.
What is clear is that several boats have already dispatched their trafficked human cargos and that the reason there is now a huge media storm is because one boat got into trouble and had to be rescued by the life boat.
More will come out on this story about the total complacency of the British government in failing to predict that this would happen.
The argument that being in the EU gives us better protection counts for nothing.
We must return the 18 Albanians that are currently in Dover or we will face our own summer migrant crisis.
The straits of Dover are not the Mediterranean with vicious tides and is one of the busiest commercial shipping lanes in the world.
Unless we stop the boats from coming many people will die.
I also believe that it has been a huge error to cut back our coast guard services. We are an island and we must protect our borders.
