THIS survey illustrates the stark choice that our country faces on June 23.
There is no status quo on the ballot paper. To Remain would mean not just net migration at the current record high levels, but at rates even higher in the future as the likes of Turkey and others become full EU members. 
The European Union is not standing still. It wants to expand, centralise and extend its open borders as far and wide as possible. 
Open borders with Turkey would be a total disaster for our country. With a population of 80 million, it would mean even more uncontrolled migration into the UK and, as the survey showed, would include a huge flow of unemployed people into Britain. 
We’ve already seen wages compressed in this country and the quality of life for many of our citizens go down due to the over-supply of unskilled migrant labour. 
Then there is the security risk. For the UK to have total open borders with a country sharing a land border with Syria, Iraq and Iran would be madness. 
We already know that Islamic State wish to do us great harm and indeed security bosses have warned that ISIS are already entering Europe in large numbers, posing as migrants and refugees. 
Don’t let anyone tell you that open borders with Turkey can’t or won’t happen if we vote to Remain in the EU. 
A deal is already being done to give Turks visa-free access and we know that the likes of David Cameron and Angela Merkel have been long-time supporters of Turkey’s bid for full EU membership. 
The alternative to all of this is that we vote to Leave, take back control of our democracy and take back control of our borders.
